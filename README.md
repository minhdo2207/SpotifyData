Spotify Full Data Engineering Project
Project Overview:
This project focuses on building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API integrated with AWS services. The pipeline is responsible for extracting data from the Spotify API, performing necessary transformations, and ultimately loading the transformed data into an AWS data storage service.

Dataset/API Used:
We utilize the comprehensive Spotify API, which provides a wealth of information about music artists, albums, and songs. Spotify API Documentation

AWS Services Utilized:
S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 is a scalable and reliable object storage service used for storing and retrieving data of any size. It is particularly well-suited for hosting media files, data backups, and static website content.

AWS Lambda: Lambda is a serverless computing service enabling the execution of code without the need for server management. It allows running code in response to events, such as changes in S3 buckets or other AWS services.

CloudWatch: CloudWatch is a monitoring service providing insights into AWS resource performance and the applications running on them. It facilitates metric collection, log monitoring, and alarm setting.

Crawler: AWS Glue Crawler is a fully managed service that automatically scans and catalogs data sources, inferring schemas to create an AWS Glue Data Catalog.

Data Catalog: The AWS Glue Data Catalog serves as a fully managed metadata repository, simplifying data discovery and management within the AWS ecosystem. It can be seamlessly integrated with other services, including Athena.

Amazon Athena: Athena is an interactive query service designed for analyzing data stored in Amazon S3. It enables easy exploration and analysis of data stored in the Glue Data Catalog or other S3 buckets.

Package Installation:
Copy code
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install spotipy
Project Execution Flow:
Extract data from Spotify API.
Configure a Lambda function to trigger data extraction every hour.
Execute the extraction code and store the raw data.
Trigger the transformation function to perform necessary data transformations and load the transformed data.
Utilize Amazon Athena to query and analyze the loaded data.
